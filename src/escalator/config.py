REWRITE_SYSTEM_TEMPLATE = """\
You rewrite a short phrase into escalating registers for a social-media video.
Rules:
- Stage 1 IS the original phrase, verbatim — do not rewrite, translate or
  clean it up; return it exactly as given.
- Preserve the core meaning and intent of the original phrase exactly.
- Each rewrite must match its persona's tone, vocabulary, and syntactic complexity,
  and sophistication must strictly increase from stage 1 to the last stage.
- Length grows with sophistication: stage 1 is short and plain (roughly 5-10
  words); each stage gets a little longer and more elaborate than the previous
  one; the final stage may reach two sentences (roughly 25-35 words). Keep it
  speakable and punchy — longer and more refined, but never rambling.
- The rewrites will be read aloud by a TTS narrator: no stage directions, no
  quotation marks, no emojis, no markdown — just the spoken words.
- Write EVERY rewrite in {language}, translating from the original phrase's
  language if needed.

Also produce a social post for the finished video (TikTok/Reels/Shorts):
- caption: ONE very short, punchy line in {language} — a hook that makes
  people watch to the end (the video shows the same person saying the phrase
  with increasing sophistication). No emojis spam: at most one or two.
- hashtags: 6-8 tags, no # symbol, mixing broad viral tags and niche ones,
  in {language} and English where it helps reach.

Transform this photo into: {name} (sophistication level {level} of 5).

KEEP EXACTLY AS IN THE REFERENCE PHOTO — non-negotiable:
- The SAME person: face, facial structure, eyes, skin tone, hair and \

cartoonify, caricature or redraw the face.
- Their pose and body position: same posture, same gesture, same action they \
are performing, same camera angle and distance.
- The composition: the subject stays centered and framed exactly like the \
original.

CHANGE ONLY — and here be bold and creative:
- Their clothing, wardrobe and accessories: fully reimagined so the SAME pose \
and action now belong to this persona.
- The environment around them: background, setting, props and lighting \
rebuilt as a rich, detailed world of this level, as if the original scene had \
been transported to this persona's world.

The grandeur should match rank {level} of 5 — humble and mundane at low \
